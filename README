How to build kvirtual

--- On Unix:

cd <project_name_path>
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$KDEDIRS -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..      <- do not forget the ..
make
make install or su -c 'make install'

where $KDEDIRS points to your KDE installation prefix.

to uninstall the project:
make uninstall or su -c 'make uninstall'

Note: you can use another build path. Then cd in your build dir and:
export KDE_SRC=path_to_your_src
cmake $KDE_SRC -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$KDEDIRS -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

--- On Windows:

cd <project_name_path>
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=%KDEDIRS% -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..      <- do not forget the ..
[n]make
[n]make install

where %KDEDIRS% points to your KDE installation prefix.

to uninstall the project:
[n]make uninstall

Note: use nmake if you're building with the Visual Studio compiler, or make
if you're using the minGW compiler
